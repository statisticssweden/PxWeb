## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/statisticssweden/PxWeb/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/statisticssweden/PxWeb/issues/new).
But befor doing so please have a look at [Github's issues](https://github.com/statisticssweden/PxWeb/issues) that the bug hasn´t already been reported.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce the bug. Be as specific as possible, it really helps!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Attachments e.g. sample file, and logs etc.

We review all new issues once a month, which means that you might not receive any immediate feedback.
